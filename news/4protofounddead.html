Proto Found Dead In Chicago After Drive-By Shooting

<p>The beloved Protegent mascot, Proto, has been found dead in Chicago after a drive-by shooting. Last night, Proto, who has long been the face of the Protegent anti-virus software, was found dead on the side of the road with several bullet wounds in and around the chest area, as well as the head. </p>

<p>Many have been wondering why the attackers would target some as well respected  and charitable as Proto, but upon further investgation, it has become apparent that Proto is not entirely the man we thought him to be.</p>

<p>Around 2 hours ago, the culprits of this crime were caught and confessed to the crime. They claim the motive behind their attack was that they had purchased methamphetamine from Proto the month prior for what they described as and "unreasonably extortionate price," and that the meth itself was "not up to the standard they paid for." So basically, Proto was a meth dealer who pushed his luck a bit too far. Stick to making shitty antivirus software, it's what you're best at.</p>
