Princess Kidnapped Again - Forced to Live In Hotel

</h1>

<p>‎Earlier this morning, Princess Peach Toadstool, ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, has been missing. Her royal subjects have been searching relentlessly for her, with none being able to make any leads. Even world famous Mushroom Kingdom detective, Shroomlock Toads, has been left stumped by this conundrum.</p>

<p>Later on, a letter was found by the Super Mario Brothers, supposedly left by the kidnapping culprit. The letter read as follows:</p>
<p>"Dear Pesky Plumbers,</p>
<p>The Koopalings and I have taken over the Mushroom Kingdom. The Princess is now a permanent guest at one of my seven Koopa Hotels. I dare you to find her if you can."</p>

<p>This letter has been traced back to Bowser, King of the Koopas, who has been known to have kidnapped the Princess several times in the past.</p>

<p>A citizen of the Mushroom Kingdom who wishes to remain anonymous has said this: "Dude, I think it's really f***ing stupid that the Princess has been kidnapped by the same guy for the fiftieth time, and this detective guy has been scratching his head for the past 4 hours.</p>

<p>We asked the Mario Brothers themselves about what their plan of action is, and in response, Mario began talking about a supposed "Instruction Book."</p>

<p>Internet users all over the Mushroom Kingdom are speculating that the Princess might actually enjoy being kidnapped due to the fact that she has been kidnapped by Bowser several times before, and refuses to increase palace security dispite being advised to several times. But that's just a theory. A game theory.</p>

<p>As of writing this, the Super Mario Brothers have just located one of these "Koopa Hotels" which are now seemingly scattered around the Mushroom Kingdom. Let's hope that the Princess is not in another castl- I mean Hotel.</p>
