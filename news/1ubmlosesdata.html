<p>‎Earlier today, an Unnamed Business Man was using his portable computing device until his system crashed. This caused the Unnamed Business Man to lose his data. After a thorough investigation, it has been concluded that the system crash was caused by a piece of malware that had been transfered onto his laptop from a public network he had connected to the previous day. Once on his device, the malicious software slowly began corrupting system files (as well as the man's data) much to the dismay and confusion of the Unnamed Business Man, who was confused as to how this could happen to his system when he has anti-virus software installed on his system. Unfortunately for the Unnamed Business Man, anti-virus was not enough.</p>

<p>This event has made many people realise that their data might also be at risk of being lost. This has made many computer users try to find a way to protect themselves, and their data from cyber threats. There is one person who claims to have a solution to this devastating cyber crisis. Proto, a representitive for Protegent 360, an anti-virus software which claims to also include data recovery software, has spoken about the current issue at hand and has brought up a potential solution.</p>

<p>This is a quote directly from Proto, who made an appearance at the scene where the original data loss incident occured:</p>
<p>"Anti-virus is not enough. You need Protegent - world's only anti-virus with data recovery software. Think beyond anti-virus. Think Protegent."</p>

<p>It should go mentioned that Protegent may not be the most trustworthy software to install, with many online users warning against the anti-virus, with some claiming that Protegent is not an effective anti-virus solution, and that the data recovery software barely functions, and others claiming the Protegent is a straight up scam. One user said this about the anti-virus</p>

<p>"Protegent sounds more like a dental cream for your ass."</p>
