<p1><center>‎so like heres some albums I'd recommend</center></p1>
<p1><center></center></p1>
<p1><center>‎A Fever You Can't Sweat Out - Panic! At The Disco</center></p1>
<p1><center>this, being the first album from the pop-rock band Panic! At The Disco, is my favourite album of all time, and that's for good reason. with ridiculously long song titles, each song in the album is almost telling a story, especially Build God, Then We'll Talk. Brendon Urie's vocals are incredible. The album is seemingly split up into two halves, with the first half being more emo-rock focussed, similar to other emo bands at the time such as Fall Out Boy or My Chemical Romance whereas the other side, after the track "Intermission", is much more unique and very 1950s. Unfortunately, due to Ryan Ross leaving the band after disagreeing with Brendon Urie about the direction in which the band should go, we will most likely never see another album like this again, especially after Brendon ending Panic! in February 2023 to focus on his child. my top 3 favourite tracks from this album are "Time to Dance", "Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks" and "Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off"</center></p1>

<p1><center>‎I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love - My Chemical Romance</center></p1>
<p1><center>i probably won't nowhere near as much about this as i did for AFYCSO but i still have a few things to say being that this is my second favourite album. i love the gothic horror theme that every song in this album has; it almost reminds me of halloween. i love the guitars as well as Gerard Way's vocals. almost everything about this album is incredible, and it's criminally underrated compared to MCR's other albums. my top 3 favourite tracks from this album are "Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us", "Cubicles" and "Demolition Lovers"</center></p1>
